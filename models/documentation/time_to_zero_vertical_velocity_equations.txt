Forces causing breaking:
F_drag
F_gravity

Total breaking force:
F_break = F_drag + F_gravity

Force, acceleration relationship:
F = m * a

Current deaccelration:
a_break = F_break / m_rocket

Acceleration, veloticy and time relationship:
a_avg = delta v / delta t = (v - v_0) / t

Approximate time to zero velocity, assuming constant deacceleration:
t_zvv = verticalSpeed / a_break
